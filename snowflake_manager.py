# dbt Zero to Hero Snowflake Importer

Hi, this webapp helps you set up your Snowflake account
and import the course resources, such as raw tables and user roles
into your Snowflake account. Simply add the snowflake hostname, username and password
and then click start setup.

**This app will do the following**:

* Create the `dbt` user using the password `dbtPassword123`
* Import the raw AirBnB tables
* Create the REPORTER role and grant it to the `dbt` user. _We'll use this role later in the course when we build a dashboard.

Please keep in mind that this is a beta version implemented in late October 2024 and it may have some rought edges.
I'd be very happy if you could provide feedback on wether the tool works and how to improve it. Just send me a message on Udemy.
